An important point raised by the TA was to make sure that we don't implement authentication since its not required, but permissions are still required.

We discussed the API design in length but make sure to:
- Ask the other group about the distance endpoint.
- Do not ask for an ID if the ID is already provided in the object.
- Update the Order object to contain all the fields.
- Add descriptions for every endpoint.

We agreed to contact group C about their slow pace of posting the spec.
